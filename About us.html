    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We’re a group of friends who came together with one simple goal — to create something meaningful while learning and having fun.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>This project started as a simple idea for a school assignment, but soon became something more. Even though we couldn’t visit Suklaphata Rastriya Nikunj in person, our curiosity led us to explore it through research, creativity, and teamwork.</p>

    <p>Every line of code, every paragraph, and every photo space here is a small reflection of how much we learned — not just about nature, but about working together and staying inspired.</p>

    <h2>Meet Our Team</h2>

    <h2>Our Effort</h2>
    <p>We spent days planning, researching, and designing this site — not just to complete a project, but to share a message: even small ideas can help protect something big.</p>
