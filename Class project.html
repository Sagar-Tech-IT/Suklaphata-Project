    <h1>Our Class Project</h1>
    <p>
      This website began as a small idea — a bunch of friends coming together, curious about the wild beauty of Suklaphata.  
      <br><br>
      What started as a coding project soon became a creative adventure — exploring the park’s stories, nature, and conservation through our own eyes.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We wanted to build something that didn’t just *talk* about Suklaphata — but made you *feel* it.  
      Each page you see was written, designed, and styled by us — inspired by the colors, sounds, and calm of nature itself.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Worked</h2>
    <p>
      We divided our work like explorers on a mission:  
      Some handled design, some coded, others researched — but every one of us added a little spark that made this project what it is.
